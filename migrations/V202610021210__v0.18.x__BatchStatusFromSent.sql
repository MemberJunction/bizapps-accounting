-- =============================================================================
-- Migration: V202610021210__v0.18.x__BatchStatusFromSent.sql
-- Description: #221 — Posted and Failed are reachable only from Sent, so the
--              database refuses every status move the batch entity refuses.
-- =============================================================================
--
-- WHY
--
-- trg_JournalEntryBatch_Immutability (50031) refused most illegal status moves,
-- but a raw UPDATE could still take a Pending or Approved batch straight to
-- Posted or Failed, recording a batch as posted, or failed and retryable,
-- without it ever being sent; and take a Failed batch to Posted without the
-- retry that looks it up in the ERP. JournalEntryBatchEntityServer's LEGAL_TRANSITIONS
-- refuses these, so only direct SQL could reach them.
--
-- WHAT CHANGES
--
-- One condition is added to the 50031 status check: a batch becomes Posted or
-- Failed only from Sent. The rest of the trigger is unchanged from
-- V202609261000, except that the 50009 message now says the send stamp changes
-- only on a send (50030).
--
-- -> Sent is not repeated here. trg_JournalEntryBatch_SendOnce (V202610021200,
-- 50030) already refuses it from anything but Approved or Failed, and fires
-- first. Altering this trigger does not reset SendOnce's First order: SQL
-- Server drops that attribute only when the ordered trigger itself is altered.
--
-- Together the two triggers now enforce the whole of LEGAL_TRANSITIONS:
--   Pending  -> Approved | Cancelled | Archived
--   Approved -> Sent | Cancelled | Archived
--   Sent     -> Posted | Failed
--   Failed   -> Sent | Cancelled | Archived
--   Posted, Cancelled, Archived: terminal
--
-- Every engine write already follows these edges: the send saves Sent before
-- it records Posted or Failed, and recordDispatchFailure marks only a Sent
-- batch Failed. The trigger checks only the update in flight, so existing rows
-- need no pre-check.
--
-- No schema or metadata change, so CodeGen has nothing to emit.
--
-- DETERMINISTIC, NOT IDEMPOTENT: this runs once, in order, against a database
-- that has the prior migrations.
